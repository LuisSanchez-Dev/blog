Hi Tomas.

First make sure that both folders have different name, then inside each folder there is a .py file, the name should be foldername_StreamlabsSystem.py. If the Chatbot still only shows one it must be that they have the same name, you must open one of the foldername_StreamlabsSystem.py and locate the line with the script name:

&lt;code&gt;ScriptName = &quot;My Script&quot; &lt;/code&gt;

You should change one file to a different name:

&lt;code&gt;ScriptName = &quot;My Script 2&quot; &lt;/code&gt;

Let me know if this worked for you, if there are still problems take a look at the bug icon on the top right to check if there are any errors while loading the scripts.

Best regards.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Appreciate the clear and concise startup guide!  Nice work. I&#039;m looking for an answer to a script redundancy issue in streamlabs chatbot.  I would like to use two scripts that are nearly identical, but chatbot recognizes them as the same script, despite them having distinct folder and file names.  How do I distinguish these scripts so that chatbot will recognize them as separate?]]></description>
